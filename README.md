2048-react
==========

This is a clone of [2048-react](https://github.com/IvanVergiliev/2048-react).What I do is re-implementing it using [Vue](https://cn.vuejs.org/),[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).
Here is the [living demo](https://pengfu.github.io/vue-2048/)

### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the dev server with hot reload at localhost:8080

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
npm run build
```
